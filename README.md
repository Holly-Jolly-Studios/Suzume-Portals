<h1 align="center">Suzume Portals</h1>

The goal of this project was to recreate an effect seen in the Makoto Shinkai film “Suzume”. In the movie, there is a Torii gate that leads to another world. Our desired final product would be a scene with an endless pool of water on one side of the gate while a field of grass would be on the other side of the gate.
