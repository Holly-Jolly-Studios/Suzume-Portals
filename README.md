<h1 align="center">Suzume Portals</h1>

he goal of this project was to recreate an effect seen in the Makoto Shinkai film “Suzume”. In the movie there is a Torii gate that leads to another world. Our desired final product would be a scene with an endless pool of water on one side of the gate while a field of grass would be on the other side of the gate.

Here's what the final product looks like!
